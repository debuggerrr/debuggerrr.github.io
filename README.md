# debuggerrr.github.io

Simple GitHub Pages portfolio for Sid. This repository contains a lightweight single-page portfolio you can customize and publish with GitHub Pages.

Files:
- `index.html` — main page
- `styles.css` — styles

Publish:
1. Commit and push to the `main` branch.
2. In your GitHub repo settings -> Pages, set the source to the `main` branch (root) and save.
3. Visit `https://debuggerrr.github.io` after a minute.

Note about Jekyll:
- I briefly added a Jekyll scaffold, but removed it to keep the repository as a simple static site. The static `index.html` is the current homepage, so GitHub Pages will serve it directly.
- To show your avatar on the static homepage, keep your photo at the repository root named `sid.png` (you already copied it). The static `index.html` references `sid.png`.

Customize:
- Replace text in `index.html` (name, bio, projects).
- Add your project links, images, or embed demos.
- For a blog or advanced features, consider using Jekyll, Hugo, or a static-site generator.
